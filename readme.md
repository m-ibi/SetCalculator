# Set Calculator

## Project Overview

This project is a Set Calculator built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to perform various set operations such as union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and more.

## Development Timeline

### Week 1: Discovering Python and Learning Basic Tkinter Functionality

During the first week, I focused on learning the basics of Python and Tkinter. This included understanding Python syntax, data structures, and how to create a basic GUI using Tkinter.

### Week 2: Integrating and Adding Basic Set Functions

In the second week, I integrated the basic set functions into the calculator. These functions included:
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Symmetric Difference
- Subset


### Week 3: Adding Further Functions like Subset, Powersets, etc.

In the third week, I added more advanced set functions such as:
- Superset
- Disjoint
- Cardinality
- Power Set
- Styling Changes

## How to Use

1. Enter the sets in the provided input fields.
2. Click the buttons to perform the desired set operations.
3. The result will be displayed below the buttons.
